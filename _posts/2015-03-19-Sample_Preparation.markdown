## Sample Preparation

To prepare the samples for indentation, the samples were first placed on an epoxy mount.  Then mechanical ploshing was done with 1200-4000 grit paper, lubricated with water for 1-2 mins each to remove the top layer of polymer found near the mold surface.  Then polishing was done with 1 um diamond suspension to remove scratches and create a uniform surface.

As a final polish, ion polishing was done to provide as stress free a surface as possible.

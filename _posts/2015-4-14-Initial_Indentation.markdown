title: Initial Results of Indentation Tests on 1 wt%
---

Indentation test were run with a 100um spherical indenter on the polished surface of a 1 wt% CNT sample.

A tests were run at a rate of 0.5 {unit} and a rate of 0.05 {unit}.

Indentation results were evaluated using codes and methodology explained in this [post](http://tonyfast.com/nsf-goali/2015/01/22/NISSAA-Code-Structure/) by Jordan Weaver.

First I am analyzing the test run at a 0.5 rate.  As an initial pass, the analyses were passed through a filter which eleminated ones with negative or overly large modulus results as well as analyses with small R^2 values.  The folowing image shows the distribution results after this first pass.

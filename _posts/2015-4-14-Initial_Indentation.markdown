Addition 4-28-2015 
Here are the load displacement curves for these tests:

Indentation test were run with a 100um spherical indenter on the polished surface of a 1 wt% CNT sample.

A tests were run at a rate of 0.5 and a rate of 0.05.

Indentation results were evaluated using codes and methodology explained in this [post](http://tonyfast.com/nsf-goali/2015/01/22/NISSAA-Code-Structure/) by Jordan Weaver.

First I am analyzing the test run at a 0.05 rate.  As an initial pass, the analyses were passed through a filter which eleminated ones with negative or overly large modulus results as well as analyses with small R^2 values.  The folowing image shows the distribution results after this first pass.

For the second pass, I limited the h* values to less than 200.

Then h_change was limited to less than 0.6

Finally the analyses were limited to the ones where the modulus fit length was greater than 50 points

A few selected stress strain curves were saved at this point.

A similar method was employed for the test at a rate of 0.5.

![Sample 2 1st pass](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7624/16515046644_d2929bfc96_z_d.jpg)

![Sample 2 2nd pass](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7685/16517301673_c5ecbfbc73_z_d.jpg)

![Sample 2 3rd pass](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8809/16529653613_da32092fbe_z_d.jpg)

And the resulting stress-strain curves were:

![Stress-strain 4](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8747/16949701898_d1af4be285_z_d.jpg)

![Stress-strain 5](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8826/16942441457_1986a728f4_z_d.jpg)

![Stress-strain 6](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8684/16962064128_0fb7016cf6_z_d.jpg)

As can be seen by examining the stress strain curves, the result is a range of values for the modulus.  
For the 0.05 rate the modulus was determined as 2.9158 with a standard deviation of 0.2363.
For the 0.5 rate the modulus was determined as 2.0833 with a standard deviation of 0.2269.

There were a total of 9 tests for each rate.  Analysis of the remainder of the tests still needs to be done.

In order to understand variances between tests, analysis of the local volume fractions of the CNTs will be important.  I am looking at methods for determining this local property. 

In addition test should now be run on the samples of different weight percentages to look at the variance between different samples.

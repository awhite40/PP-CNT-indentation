##Indentation Tests

After surface preparation, samples from the neat polymer and 5 wt% samples were testing with a 1500 um indenter.  The large indenter size was chosen to ensure inclusion of  a high number of carbon nano tubes in the tested area and to remove the effect of surface defects.

This graph shows the expected trends in the modulus.  There is much less variation between tests in the neat polymer than in the 5 wt%.  This is the result of uneven dispersion of the reinforcing nanotubes.  
Now that the protocol has been successfully employed on these samples, the next step is to indent in the narrow section of the dog-bone samples.  I will be indenting in the direction of the tensile tests for comparison with those tests.

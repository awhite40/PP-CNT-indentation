## Materials
###Polypropylene 
Polypropylene(PP) used in this study was provided by Lyondell Basell in powder form with particles ranging from 100um to 300um

###Reinforcement
The nanoreinforcements used are multi-walled CNT purchased from Cheat Tubes, VT.  They have an outer diameter of 20-30 nm, an inner diameter or 5-10nm and length of 10-30 um.  


## Characterization 

### Tensile Testing
Tensile tests were preformed on dogbone shaped samples both above and below the glass transition temperature of PP.  The tests above Tg are the most relevant to this study as they will be used to compare with the indentation tests.  The following figure gives a summary of the results of the tensile tests for the various weights of reinforcement.

The following table shows the changes in modulus and strength of the material with increasing reinforcement.  The data shows the expected trend of increasing modulus and strength with increasing reinforcement.  The largest increase can be seen with the addition of the first 1 wt % of CNT.  


Nanotube | Modulus |Strength
| Wt. % | GPa | MPa |
| 0 |  1.38+-0.04  |  33.14+-0.45  |
| 1 |  1.55+-0.03  | 35.78+-0.43  |
| 3 |  1.68+-0.05  |  38.2+-0.65  |
| 5 |  1.87+-0.04  |  39.72+-0.83  |

### SEM studies

SEM studies were also performed to look at aggregation, voids and waviness of the reinforcements.  This representative image shows both agglomerates (red circles) and voids (red arrows).

Based on this data we expect to have a much larger variation in the indentation results of reinforced material compared to the neat polymer.
